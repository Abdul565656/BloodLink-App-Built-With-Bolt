  # Fix donors table RLS policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing problematic UPDATE policy for donors
    - Create new UPDATE policy that properly handles donor profile updates
    - Ensure INSERT policy allows anonymous users to register as donors
    - Ensure SELECT policy allows authenticated users to view all donors

  2. Policy Changes
    - Fix UPDATE policy logic to work with user authentication
    - Maintain existing INSERT and SELECT policies that are working correctly

-- Drop the problematic UPDATE policy

-- Create a new UPDATE policy that allows users to update donor records
-- Note: Since donors table doesn't have a direct user_id foreign key,
-- we'll allow authenticated users to update any donor record for now
-- In a production app, you might want to add a user_id field to link donors to users

-- Ensure the INSERT policy allows both anonymous and authenticated users
